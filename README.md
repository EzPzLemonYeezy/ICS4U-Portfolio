<h2>Summary of top 10 Modules:</h2>
<ol>
<li><h4>Intro to Js: Drawing and Animation:</h4>
  <h5>Intro to JS was the first khan academy module I did. Since this module teaches more about all the basics of JavaScript and how to use it, I found it to be a little boring. The challenges especially started to become repetitive, which only made it more boring. Eventhough it took willpower to complete, in the end this module became very crucial for the rest of the JavaScript modules. Without the basis, the other modules would have become much harder. The introduction coding was the backbone of my other modules that I was able to complete. Having this basis coding techniques and lessons helped me experiment and play with other projects I accomplished and allowed me to push them further.</h5></li>

<li><h4>Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Webpages:</h4>
  <h5>This section of the coding was even more mind numbing and repetitive. Out of all the languages I've learned throughout taking computer science, HTML seems to be the most linear and limited, compared to the stuff I could do with JavaScript. Eventhough I found this one to be the most boring, I understand how important and crucial learning to use this code is. For ecample, this website was created using HTML, and it will help me create more websites that I will be able to show to an employer.</h5></li>

<li><h4>Advanced JS: Natural Simulations:</h4>
  <h5></h5></li>

<li><h4>Advanced JS: Games and Visualizations</h4>
  <h5></h5></li>

<li><h4>HTML/JS: Making Webpages Interactive:</h4>
  <h5></h5></li>

<li><h4>Algorithms:</h4>
  <h5></h5></li>

<li><h4>Debugging:</h4>
  <h5>In this module, I actually did very little coding. The point of learning this module was to help me be able to see errors and learn how to efficiently fix them. It also showed me how to test different areas of the code to do checks. This is especially important, since in my career as a software engineer, I will have to be coding and cooperating with others code aswell, so learning the methods of debugging and fixing code will help me immensely.</h5></li>

<li><h4>Basic Algorithm Scripting</h4>
  <h5>This module taught me how to code using basic algorithmic techniques. Through the lessons I was able to learn how to convert celsius to fahrenheit, factor numbers, and many more. </h5></li>

<li><h4>Bees and Bombs</h4>
  <h5>I included this module because it was probably the most fun I had coding, while it was also very beneficial. It really challenged me because I had to take the algorithmic code and convert it to object oriented. It also gave me a sense of being able to work and cooperate with other people on the same project, which is especially important in software engineering. Being able to actually complete the code that made it work felt very rewarding and accomplished because I had to make the code. I had to playt around with it and experiment with many different aspects using the p5 web editor.</h5></li>

<li><h4>Mathematical Rose Petal</h4>
  <h5>During this code I had to watch the coding challenge online on the mathematical rose. The video gave me an understanding on the concepts I has to incorporate. It taught me how to take a basis code given to me and have to elevate it. I had to elevate this code by including color and a change in radius into the customizations you can do with the mathrose. </h5></li>
