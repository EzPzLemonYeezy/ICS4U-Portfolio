<h2>Summary of top 10 Modules:</h2>
<ol>
<li><h4>Intro to Js: Drawing and Animation:</h4>
  <h5>Intro to JS was the first khan academy module I did. Since this module teaches more about all the basics of JavaScript and how to use it, I found it to be a little boring. The challenges especially started to become repetitive, which only made it more boring. Eventhough it took willpower to complete, in the end this module became very crucial for the rest of the JavaScript modules. Without the basis, the other modules would have become much harder. It taught me how to use variables, loops, arrays, and object oriented design.</h5></li>

<li><h4>Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Webpages:</h4>
  <h5>This section of the coding was even more mind numbing and repetitive. Out of all the languages I've learned throughout taking computer science, HTML seems to be the most linear and limited, compared to the stuff I could do with JavaScript. Eventhough I found this one to be the most boring, I understand how important and crucial learning to use this code is. For ecample, this website was created using HTML, and it will help me create more websites that I will be able to show to an employer. It taught me all about how to style and format code, and also concepts like how to select using id or class, and creating links and styling.</h5></li>

<li><h4>Advanced JS: Natural Simulations:</h4>
  <h5>Natural Simulations was definitely the most fun out of the modules in khan academy. It taught me how to create pictures using sound functions, incorporate forces, oscillate objects, create particle systems that have certain lifespans, and much more. This module helped me create objects and movers and be able to orient and move them as I code. This will help me be able to express my creative abilities and code things in different ways.</h5></li>

<li><h4>Advanced JS: Games and Visualizations</h4>
  <h5>The games and visualizations portion taught me how to do many things like create scenes in succession, creating buttons, use of transformations. The transformations definitely helped me conceptualize and understand what the different orientations were doing when creating my Bees and Bombs project. It showed me how perspective greatly changes appearance and is a tool that I can reflect on and use in the projects to come.</h5></li>

<li><h4>HTML/JS: Making Webpages Interactive:</h4>
  <h5>Through working out this section, I was able to learn how to manipulate HTML code using the DOM(Document Object Model). It taught me how to access DOM using methods like finding the ID of each element, or changing its ID, how to modify different attributes like style and class. I even learned how to make a cat walk. These different elements will help me when I need to be able to modify my own HTML code and change things efficeintly. Its something that I see myself having to use alot in the future, so knowing how to do it makes it that much easier.</h5></li>

<li><h4>Algorithms:</h4>
  <h5>This section taught me the basis of how to impliment algorithms in code. It taught me different search methods like binary, insetion and selection, how to use asymptotic notation, recursive algorithms and many more. Another really important aspect was learning how to represent graphs, which I thought was really helpful, since its a way of being able to describe data in a way other people can clearly see. This section however, was rally complicated and I'm still not sure I completely understand, but even just seeing whats happening will help me easier understand these kinds of concepts when I face them in university.</h5></li>

<li><h4>Debugging:</h4>
  <h5>In this module, I actually did very little coding. The point of learning this module was to help me be able to see errors and learn how to efficiently fix them. It also showed me how to test different areas of the code to do checks. This is especially important, since in my career as a software engineer, I will have to be coding and cooperating with others code aswell, so learning the methods of debugging and fixing code will help me immensely.</h5></li>

<li><h4>Basic Algorithm Scripting</h4>
  <h5>This module taught me how to code using basic algorithmic techniques. Through the lessons I was able to learn how to convert celsius to fahrenheit, factor numbers, and many more. These techniques are ones that I can apply in real live scenarios and will really help me when having to face some of these challenges in the work life.</h5></li>

<li><h4>Bees and Bombs</h4>
  <h5>I included this module because it was probably the most fun I had coding, while it was also very beneficial. It really challenged me because I had to take the algorithmic code and convert it to object oriented. It also gave me a sense of being able to work and cooperate with other people on the same project, which is especially important in software engineering. Being able to actually complete the code that made it work felt very rewarding and accomplished because I had to make the code. I had to playt around with it and experiment with many different aspects using the p5 web editor.</h5></li>

<li><h4>Mathematical Rose Petal</h4>
  <h5>During this code I had to watch the coding challenge online on the mathematical rose. The video gave me an understanding on the concepts I has to incorporate. It taught me how to take a basis code given to me and have to elevate it. I had to elevate this code by including color and a change in radius into the customizations you can do with the mathrose. </h5></li>
